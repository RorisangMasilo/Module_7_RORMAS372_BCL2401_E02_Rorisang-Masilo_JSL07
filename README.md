# [JSL07] Submission: Proud of your Progress

## Project Brief

Create a personalized certificate of achievement with the "Proud of Your Progress Certificate Generator". This web application requires users to input their name, a personalized message, and the course name to dynamically generate a certificate displayed in a modal.

## Development Objectives

- **Dynamic Content:** Dynamically generate the certificate's content based on user input, ensuring it matches the reference solution.
- **Modal Implementation:** Show the certificate in a modal upon form submission; the modal should initially be hidden.
- **Interaction Handling:** Enable modal display with form submission and allow closing with a close button. Ensure form inputs are cleared post-submission.

## Reflections

### Areas of Mastery

- **Reading code:** Honestly, the personal joy of being able to read a code. Tears of Joy, I can see...

### Challenges

- **Modal Implementation:** Showcasing the certificate in a modal upon form submission; the modal which should initially be hidden was simple as it was already functional. But unfortunately I m=hinder the functionallity with coding that I was not fully engaged with.

### Areas of Improvement

- **New Focus:** I would like to focus on would be the innerHTML syntax along with the template literals.
- **Commits:** Improve my commit messages, to track everything and communicate changes efficiently.

### Overall Learning Experience

Overall learning experience has been a bit more positive, the ability to read code and understand what the code may need and interpret code better.
